# Experimental Results of MT-MVSNet on Public Datasets

This section presents the test results of **MT-MVSNet** on the public datasets **DTU** and **Tanks & Temples**. The results are provided in the form of unique point cloud files, each of which is distinct and non-replicable. The evaluation metrics for the DTU dataset can be assessed using MATLAB code, with reference to the **MVSNet** method (available at: [MVSNet GitHub](https://github.com/YoYo000/MVSNet)). 

Due to the large storage requirements of the point cloud files, the DTU test results are stored on Google Drive. Meanwhile, the results for the Tanks and Temples dataset are displayed on the official Tanks and Temples public site. Details are as follows:

1. **Test Results on DTU Dataset**: The results can be downloaded from Google Drive at the following link: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OlcHlkrwVOSA5i2IAVQN8rA7VqKt7ecx?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto).

2. **Test Results on Tanks and Temples Dataset**: These results evaluate both the fine-tuned and unfine-tuned BlendedMVS models. The test results can be accessed via the following links:
