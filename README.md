Experimental results of MT-MVSNet on public datasets

Here we provide the test results of MT-MVSNet on the public datasets DTU and Tanks & Temples, the test results are presented in the form of point cloud files, each point cloud file is unique and unrepeatable, the results on the DTU dataset can be evaluated by the metrics through the MATLAB code, and the evaluation can be referred to the MVSNet method (https://github.com/YoYo000/MVSNet). Due to the large storage of point cloud files, the test results of DTU are stored in google cloud drive, and the test results of Tanks and Temples have been shown in Tanks and Temples official public display, details can be seen as follows.

① MT-MVSNet test results on DTU dataset, please download on google cloud drive, the link is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OlcHlkrwVOSA5i2IAVQN8rA7VqKt7ecx?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-hero-goto.

② The test results on the Tanks and Temples dataset have been displayed on the official website. The results evaluate the BlendedMVS fine-tuned and unfine-tuned models. The test results can be accessed via the following links: https://www.tanksandtemples.org/details/7397/ and https://www.tanksandtemples.org/details/7425/.


Experimental Results of MT-MVSNet on Public Datasets
This section presents the test results of MT-MVSNet on the public datasets DTU and Tanks & Temples. The results are provided in the form of unique point cloud files, each of which is distinct and non-replicable. The evaluation metrics for the DTU dataset can be assessed using MATLAB code, with reference to the MVSNet method (available at: MVSNet GitHub).

Due to the large storage requirements of the point cloud files, the DTU test results are stored on Google Drive. Meanwhile, the results for the Tanks and Temples dataset are displayed on the official Tanks and Temples public site. Details are as follows:

MT-MVSNet Test Results on DTU Dataset: The results can be downloaded from Google Drive at the following link: Google Drive Link.

Test Results on Tanks and Temples Dataset: These results evaluate both the fine-tuned and unfine-tuned BlendedMVS models. The test results can be accessed via the following links:
