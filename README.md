Experimental results on public datasets

Here we provide the test results of MT-MVSNet on the public datasets of Multiview Stereo Vision, DTU and Tanks and Temples, the test results are presented in the form of point cloud files, each point cloud file is unique and unrepeatable, the results on the DTU dataset can be evaluated by the metrics through the MATLAB code, and the evaluation can be referred to the MVSNet method. Due to the large storage of point cloud files, the test results of DTU are stored in google cloud drive, and the test results of Tanks and Temples have been shown in Tanks and Temples official public display, details can be seen as follows.

① MT-MVSNet test results on DTU dataset, please download on google cloud drive, the link is:

② The test results on Tanks and Temples dataset have been shown in Tanks and Temples official public display, the link is.
